    <h2>Formerly Unhackable Andy</h2>
    <p>
        Formerly known as "Unhackable Andy", I'm still a legend in the tech world! Yes, recently there was a minor
        incident where an insignificant so-called "hack" took place, but let's get a few things straight. First and
        foremost, I was told that my credentials would be SECURE there. So it's not my fault! Sheesh.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since that unfortunate incident (which we won't harp on, but I still blame that treacherous parrot), I've
        embarked
        on some new projects. Admittedly, things haven't been as smooth as they once were. Take, for instance, my
        "VaultChain". Designed to be the successor to "Impenetrable Wallet", early testers found they
        could occasionally... see other people’s balances. A minor oversight. Then there was the "Titanium Lockbox",
        hailed
        as a quantum-safe encryption tool. Sadly, it couldn't handle basic password attempts like "password123". I still
        maintain
        it's because users didn't read the manual properly.
    </p>

        Sure, the critics are having a field day. But they're just jealous. So, to all the haters: "If it's coded by
        Andy, it's
        unhackable." Just disregard that one time...
    </p>

    <p>
        If you think that’s going to stop me, think again. My revenge is imminent. In the meantime, you can still follow
        my unparalleled genius on GitHub!
